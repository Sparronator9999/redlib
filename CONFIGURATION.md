# Configuration

You can configure Redlib further using environment variables. For example:

```bash
REDLIB_DEFAULT_SHOW_NSFW=on redlib
```

```bash
REDLIB_DEFAULT_WIDE=on REDLIB_DEFAULT_THEME=dark redlib -r
```

You can also configure Redlib with a configuration file named `redlib.toml`. For example:

```toml
REDLIB_DEFAULT_WIDE = "on"
REDLIB_DEFAULT_USE_HLS = "on"
REDLIB_SCRAPE_COMMENT_PREFETCH = 0
```

Numbers and booleans work as well as strings; `true`/`false` mean `on`/`off`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're deploying Redlib using the **Docker CLI or Docker Compose**, environment variables can be defined in a [`.env` file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/), allowing you to centralize and manage configuration in one place.
>
> To configure Redlib using a `.env` file, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit it accordingly.
>
> If using the Docker CLI, add ` --env-file .env` to the command that runs Redlib. For example:
>
> ```bash
> docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ghcr.io/nachtalb/redlib:latest
> ```
>
> If using Docker Compose, no changes are needed as the `.env` file is already referenced in `compose.yaml` via the `env_file: .env` line.

## Command Line Flags

Redlib supports the following command line flags. They take precedence over environment variables and `redlib.toml`; environment variables in turn take precedence over `redlib.toml`.

- `-4`, `--ipv4-only`: Listen on IPv4 only.
- `-6`, `--ipv6-only`: Listen on IPv6 only.
- `-r`, `--redirect-https`: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS (no longer functional).
- `-a`, `--address <ADDRESS>`: Sets address to listen on. Default is `[::]`.
- `-p`, `--port <PORT>`: Port to listen on. Default is `8080`.
- `-H`, `--hsts <EXPIRE_TIME>`: HSTS header to tell browsers that this site should only be accessed over HTTPS. Default is `604800`.

## Instance settings

Assign a default value for each instance-specific setting by passing environment variables to Redlib in the format `REDLIB_{X}`. Replace `{X}` with the setting name (see list below) in capital letters.

| Name                      | Possible values | Default value                          | Description                                                                                               |

| `SOURCE_URL`              | String          | `https://github.com/Nachtalb/redlib`   | Link to the source code for this instance. The update check on error pages compares against this GitHub repository's `main` branch. |

### Reddit session

Reddit only serves post pages to logged-in sessions. Set `REDLIB_REDDIT_COOKIE` to the `reddit_session` cookie of a logged-in reddit.com browser (DevTools → Application → Cookies); no other cookie is needed. Separate several sessions with `|` to rotate between them:

```bash
REDLIB_REDDIT_COOKIE="reddit_session=...|reddit_session=..."
```

The `reddit_session=` prefix is optional. A whole `Cookie` header works too, as long as it has `reddit_session` in it. Sessions whose `reddit_session` has expired (it lasts about six months) are skipped with a warning in the log.

To add or remove sessions without a restart, put them in a file and point `REDLIB_REDDIT_COOKIE_FILE` at it. Each line is one session in the same form, lines starting with `#` are comments. Redlib checks the file for changes every 10 seconds; if it can't be read, the sessions read last stay in use. Both settings can be combined.

```bash
# /etc/redlib/sessions.txt
# throwaway 1
reddit_session=...
# throwaway 2
reddit_session=...
```

With Docker, mount the file read-only, e.g. `-v ./sessions.txt:/sessions.txt:ro` with `REDLIB_REDDIT_COOKIE_FILE=/sessions.txt`. Mount its directory instead if your editor replaces the file when saving: a single-file mount keeps showing the old one.

**Use a throwaway account**, never your main one: the instance's traffic runs through it and Reddit may ban it. Keep the value secret. Pressing "Log out" on reddit.com ends the session.

The `ghcr.io/nachtalb/redlib:latest-obscura` image (amd64 only, or `cargo build --release --features obscura`) can also send a session's requests through the embedded [Obscura](https://github.com/h4ckf0r0day/obscura) headless browser: the `obscura-cookied-json` backend. `latest` and default builds don't have it.

### Stale cache

Pages are cached for 30 seconds as before. Besides that, Redlib keeps the last good copy of each Reddit response in RAM, zstd-compressed, least recently used dropped first once `REDLIB_STALE_CACHE_MB` is full. A copy is only used when every backend fails because Reddit blocks, rate limits, errors or doesn't answer; the page then shows a bar saying how old it is. Real answers like a deleted post or a private subreddit are never covered up. Nothing is written to disk, so a restart empties it.

A listing page takes about 20 KB, a post with its comments 5–10 KB, so the default fits a few thousand pages.

### Scrape fallback

When the backends before it fail, the `scraped` backend loads a post page's comments from the HTML Reddit serves logged-out visitors. It shows Reddit's first batch; "More comments" and "More replies" fetch more when clicked. To load more up front, set `REDLIB_SCRAPE_COMMENT_PREFETCH` to the number of extra requests per page, e.g. `5`.

Scraped pages cost Reddit extra requests and may break when Reddit changes its pages. Set `REDLIB_ENABLE_SCRAPE_FALLBACK=off` to show the block error instead.

### Backend order

<details>
<summary>Which backend loads what, and how to change the order</summary>

Redlib tries backends one after another until one returns the page or Reddit gives a real answer (not found, private, banned). Set the order per kind of request with `REDLIB_ENDPOINTS_<KIND>`, or for all kinds with `REDLIB_ENDPOINTS`. Backends left out are never used; ones without a session, or not in the build, are skipped. The log lists each kind's order at startup.

```bash
REDLIB_ENDPOINTS_COMMENTS="cookied-json,gql,scraped"
```

While running, Redlib reorders the listed backends by how often each worked in the last half hour or so, counting session backends as twice as expensive (they use up the account's request budget). Your order is where it starts after a restart, and where a backend drifts back to once its failures are old, so a blocked backend gets tried again later. `/info` shows the current order and each backend's score.

`json` is Reddit's API without an account, `cookied-json` the same with a session from `REDLIB_REDDIT_COOKIE`, `gql` Reddit's GraphQL API (what the Android app uses), `scraped` comments from the HTML Reddit serves logged-out visitors, and `obscura-cookied-json` a session through Obscura (`latest-obscura` only).

¹ Skipped without a request for feeds of several subreddits (`r/a+b`, the front page of your subscriptions).

² Reddit [retired r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddithelp/comments/1rfmh8h/a_helpful_link_to_rall/) and answers `/r/all.json` with 403, but still serves the same feed as `/r/all+.json`, which is requested instead.

³ The old GraphQL feed sends about 8 posts per request, so a page takes up to `REDLIB_GQL_FEED_REQUESTS` requests.

## Default user settings

Assign a default value for each user-modifiable setting by passing environment variables to Redlib in the format `REDLIB_DEFAULT_{Y}`. Replace `{Y}` with the setting name (see list below) in capital letters.

## Forward proxies

Redlib's HTTP client, [wreq](https://docs.rs/wreq/latest/wreq/#proxies), uses the standard proxy variables, so all Reddit traffic can go through a proxy. Set `ALL_PROXY` for everything, or `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` per scheme, and `NO_PROXY` for hosts to reach directly. The Obscura build's browser uses them too.

```bash
ALL_PROXY=socks5h://user:pass@proxy.example:1080 redlib
```

Schemes: `http://`, `https://`, `socks4://`, `socks4a://`, `socks5://` and `socks5h://` (DNS through the proxy).
