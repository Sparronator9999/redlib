# Redlib (Sparronator9999 fork)

My personal fork of [Redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib), with various new features added.

## Changes from upstream

- Various CSS cleanups, compatibility fixes, and minor style changes, for example:
  - Added a missing "submit" button to the "Search comments" search box.
  - More compact comment threads, especially on mobile screens.
  - Increased touch area for various hard-to-hit links/buttons.
  - Reduced layout breakage on some older devices (i.e. [those without CSS grid support](https://caniuse.com/css-grid), and [those missing proper flexbox support](https://caniuse.com/flexbox)).
  - Fixed speed controllers not being positioned properly for those using the [Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/codebicycle/videospeed) extension.
- Removed response compression support.
  - Public instance users should already have Redlib behind a reverse proxy, which can apply compression itself. If brotli compression is still wanted, third-party modules exist for [nginx](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli) and [Caddy](https://github.com/dunglas/caddy-cbrotli).
  - I may add this feature back behind a compile-time flag if there is enough demand for it.

An alternative private front-end to Reddit, with its origins in [Libreddit](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit).

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a fork of [redlib-org/redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib).**
> It ships multi-arch images for amd64, 386, arm64, arm/v7 and arm/v6, and includes many features and fixes from unmerged upstream pull requests plus its own. See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for the full list of changes.

> [!TIP]
> Run this fork's image, **`ghcr.io/nachtalb/redlib:latest`**, rather than upstream's `quay.io/redlib/redlib`.

> [!WARNING]
> If Reddit blocks your instance's requests, set a session in `REDLIB_REDDIT_COOKIE` ([setup](CONFIGURATION.md#reddit-session)).

**10-second pitch:** Redlib is a private front-end like [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) but for Reddit. Browse the coldest takes of [r/unpopularopinion](https://farside.link/redlib/r/unpopularopinion) without being [tracked](#reddit).

- 🚀 Fast: written in Rust for blazing-fast speeds and memory safety
- ☁️ Light: no JavaScript, no ads, no tracking, no bloat
- 🕵 Private: all requests are proxied through the server, including media
- 🔒 Secure: strong [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) prevents browser requests to Reddit

# Comparison

This section outlines how Redlib compares to Reddit in terms of speed and privacy.

## Speed

<details>
<summary>PageSpeed Insights results from January 12, 2024</summary>

> ⚠️ **Warning:** these numbers are outdated. Current instances may vary, as they adjust automatically to Reddit's blocking efforts.

Results from Google PageSpeed Insights ([Redlib Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fredlib.matthew.science%2F), [Reddit Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https://www.reddit.com)).

| Performance metric  | Redlib   | Reddit    |

# Deployment

This section covers multiple ways of deploying Redlib. Using Docker is recommended for production.

For configuration options, see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md).

Images are on [ghcr.io](https://github.com/Nachtalb/redlib/pkgs/container/redlib) for `amd64`, `386`, `arm64`, `arm/v7` and `arm/v6`.

<details>
<summary><b>Docker Compose</b></summary>

Copy `compose.yaml` and `.env.example` (as `.env`), and adjust them, for example the port.

```bash
docker compose up -d    # start Redlib in the background
docker logs -f redlib   # follow its logs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Docker CLI</b></summary>

```bash
docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/nachtalb/redlib:latest             # listen on port 8080
docker run -d --name redlib -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 ghcr.io/nachtalb/redlib:latest   # behind a reverse proxy: local only
docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ghcr.io/nachtalb/redlib:latest  # with settings from .env
docker logs -f redlib                                                              # follow its logs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Podman (Quadlets)</b></summary>

> ❗ **Important:** This assumes a systemd-based distro with [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation), and `loginctl enable-linger <username>` so the service starts without you logging in.

Copy `redlib.container` and `.env.example` (as `.env`) to `~/.config/containers/systemd/` and adjust them, then reboot or:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload          # pick up the new files
systemctl --user start redlib.service   # start Redlib
systemctl --user status redlib.service  # check on it
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Binary (Linux)</b></summary>

On Linux, grab a static binary from [the latest release](https://github.com/Nachtalb/redlib/releases/latest), rebuilt on every push to `main`. It has builds for `x86_64`, `i686`, `aarch64`, `armv7` and `arm` (v6), plus `SHA256SUMS`.

```bash
curl -fL -o redlib https://github.com/Nachtalb/redlib/releases/latest/download/redlib-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl  # pick your architecture
sudo chmod +x redlib && sudo chown root:root redlib  # make it executable, owned by root
sudo cp ./redlib /usr/bin/redlib                     # install it
redlib                                               # listen on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

> ❗ **Important:** If you're proxying Redlib through NGINX (see [issue #122](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit/issues/122#issuecomment-782226853)), add `proxy_http_version 1.1;` above your `proxy_pass` line.

#### Running as a systemd service

You can use the systemd service available in `contrib/redlib.service`
(install it on `/etc/systemd/system/redlib.service`).

That service can be optionally configured in terms of environment variables by
creating a file in `/etc/redlib.conf`. Use the `contrib/redlib.conf` as a
template. You can also add any of the settings in
[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md).

When "Proxying using NGINX" where the proxy is on the same machine, you should
guarantee nginx waits for this service to start. Edit
`/etc/systemd/system/redlib.service.d/reverse-proxy.conf`:

```conf
[Unit]
Before=nginx.service
```

### Running using an OpenRC script

You can use the OpenRC script available in `contrib/redlib.openrc`
(install it to `/etc/init.d/redlib`) to run Redlib as a service on distros
using OpenRC as their init system (e.g. Alpine, Gentoo).

Like with the systemd service, Redlib can be configured with environment
variables, however the file should be installed to `/etc/redlib-env.sh`,
and should follow the template at `contrib/redlib-env.sh`.

Unlike the systemd service, the listen address and port **must** be configured
directly in the OpenRC script. This can be done by changing the value of
`command_args` to `-a <ADDRESS> -p <PORT>`, replacing `<ADDRESS>` and `<PORT>`
with the IP address and port you want Redlib to listen on, respectively.

If proxying using NGINX (or another reverse proxy), you can modify the
`depend()` function as follows to wait for it to start before Redlib does
(replace `nginx` with your reverse proxy):

```sh
depend()
{
    need net
    before nginx
}
```

<summary><b>launchd (macOS)</b></summary>

If you are on macOS, you can use the [launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) service available in `contrib/redlib.plist`.

Install it with `cp contrib/redlib.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

Load and start it with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/redlib.plist`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cloudflare WAF rule</b></summary>

Behind Cloudflare, a custom WAF rule with the action **Managed Challenge** keeps bots and scrapers off your instance, so they don't burn through its Reddit quota. Visitors solve the challenge once and keep the `cf_clearance` cookie; static files, the health badge, `/info.json` and an optional status probe with a secret header pass without one. This is the rule r.naa.gg uses, with your host and a random secret filled in:

```
(http.request.full_uri wildcard r"https://redlib.example.com/*"
 and not http.cookie contains "cf_clearance"
 and not ends_with(http.request.uri.path, ".css")
 and not ends_with(http.request.uri.path, ".js")
 and not ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "touch-icon-iphone.png")
 and not ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "favicon.ico")
 and not ends_with(http.request.uri.path, ".woff2")
 and not ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "manifest.json")
 and http.request.uri.path ne "/healthz/reddit.json"
 and http.request.uri.path ne "/info.json"
 and not (http.request.uri.path in {"/settings" "/healthz/reddit"}
          and http.request.headers["x-status-probe"][0] eq "<random secret>"))
```

Paste it under Security → WAF → Custom rules → Edit expression. Leave out the last condition if you don't run a status page.

<!-- ## Cargo

Make sure Rust stable is installed along with `cargo`, Rust's package manager.

```bash
cargo install libreddit
``` -->

<!-- ## AUR

For ArchLinux users, Redlib is available from the AUR as [`libreddit-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libreddit-git).

```bash
yay -S libreddit-git
```
## NetBSD/pkgsrc

For NetBSD users, Redlib is available from the official repositories.

```bash
pkgin install libreddit
```

Or, if you prefer to build from source

```bash
cd /usr/pkgsrc/libreddit
make install
``` -->

---

# Configuration

Redlib is configured with environment variables, a `redlib.toml` file or command-line flags. All settings, the Reddit session, the backend order and proxies are described in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md).

---

# Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nachtalb/redlib && cd redlib
cargo build --release              # the binary ends up in target/release/redlib
cargo build --release --features obscura  # with the Obscura browser (amd64 and arm64 hosts only)
```

Redlib talks to Reddit through [wreq](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq), which uses [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/) with wreq's patches (via the [`btls-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/btls-sys) crate) so its TLS handshake looks like a real browser's. The BoringSSL source ships with the crate and is patched and compiled during the build, so you need `git`, `cmake`, a C/C++ compiler and `libclang` (for bindgen). Certificates are checked against Mozilla's trust store compiled into the binary.

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libclang-dev
```

On Windows (not tested by this fork), install MSVC, which you likely already have for Rust, then:

```pwsh
# Update your PATH afterwards; some installers don't (hence -i, interactive mode).
winget install -i Kitware.CMake
winget install -i NASM.NASM
winget install -i LLVM.LLVM
```
